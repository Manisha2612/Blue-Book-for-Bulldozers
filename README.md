# Blue-Book-for-Bulldozers
Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers.

For this Project,I have used Blue Book for Bulldozers Kaggle Competition datasets: "The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations."
